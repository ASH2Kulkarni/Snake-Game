# Snake-Game
Description:
Created a classic Snake game using Java, focusing on implementing core game mechanics, user interaction, and graphical rendering. The game includes a snake that grows in length as it consumes food items randomly placed on the game board. The player controls the snake's direction using keyboard inputs, navigating it to avoid collisions with walls and its own body. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
Technical Details:
Java Swing: Leveraged Java's Swing library for creating the game's graphical user interface, including JFrame for the game window, JPanel for rendering components, and JLabels for displaying game information.
Game Loop: Implemented a game loop to continuously update and render the game state, ensuring smooth gameplay and responsiveness to user input.
Data Structures: Used arrays  to manage the snake's body segments and coordinate positions, facilitating movement and collision detection efficiently.
